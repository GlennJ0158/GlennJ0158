- 👋 Hi, I’m @GlennJ0158

I'm a ROF (Retired Old Fart) who started programming when 8K of memory was a lot and you could actually look at the metal donuts that
were wired together on the board (core memory), 1.2 MB pizza box disk drives were the max, and speeds were measured in kilohertz.  
I've played on old iron (IBM 1401), big iron (IBM 360 series), small iron (DEC Vax), and others.  
Currently running a "gaming" PC which I got when the last one died.  

My current background project is to turn off all the silly lights (Fan Lights, GForce Card Lights, Mouse and Keyboard lights and Other Annoying Lights).

I worked at Advanced Data Management on a network (sort of) data base called DRS which primarily ran on DEC Vax equipment in the '80s.

I co-owned and co-founded JK Group, a company supporting employee influenced philanthropy (we were the back end for matching gift, volunteer, payroll deduction 
and other corporate charitable giving from the '90s through 2005 when I retired.

I motorcycle both on and off pavement, wood turn, do a little CNC and 3D printing and generally keep myself entertained.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

Most things.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

PureBasic because it has a good IDE, was inexpensive, and I think it will do what I need it to do.  My coding background is more in ASM, Fortran,
COBOL, Pascal, C and other more obscure languages.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Nothing at the moment. My skill set has gone beyond rusty and I doubt I would be of practical use to anyone. This will hopefully change over time
and I will update as seems appropriate.

- 📫 How to reach me ...

Glenn.Catalog@verizon.net is a good first contact spot.  I don't live on the computer any more so it may take several days to get a response.
